I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [Information Technology Institute](https://www.iti.gr/iti/index.html) of [Center for Research & Technology Hellas](https://www.certh.gr/), in the [Multimedia Knowledge and Social Media Analytics Laboratory](https://mklab.iti.gr/), part of the [M4D group](https://m4d.iti.gr/).

Previously, I earned my Ph.D. in Natural Language Processing from [Aristotle University of Thessaloniki](https://www.csd.auth.gr/en/), under the supervision of [Ioannis Vlahavas](https://intelligence.csd.auth.gr/people/vlahavas/) as part of the [Intelligent Systems Lab @AUTH](https://intelligence.csd.auth.gr/). Before that, I received my B.S. in Computer Science from [University of Essex](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/computer-science-and-electronic-engineering) in 2014 and my M.S. in Big Data and Text Analytics from [University of Essex](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/computer-science-and-electronic-engineering) in 2015, where I worked with [Udo Kruschwitz](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZCaIF_wAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Massimo Poesio](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=89aa1X0AAAAJ&hl=en). 

My research is focused on Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. Specifically, I am working on the combination of Coreference Resolution and Language Models in order to model distant intra-linguistic features, with minimal computational cost. Generally, I am interested in self-supervised learning and it's applications past Natural Language Processing to a multi-modal scope. If you are interested in collaborating, feel free to reach out.
