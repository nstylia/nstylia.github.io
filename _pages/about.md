I am a PhD candidate at [Aristotle University of Thessaloniki](https://www.csd.auth.gr/en/) affiliated with the [Intelligent Systems Lab @AUTH](https://intelligence.csd.auth.gr/), under the supervision of [Ioannis Vlahavas](https://intelligence.csd.auth.gr/people/vlahavas/).

Previously, I received my B.S. in Computer Science from [University of Essex](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/computer-science-and-electronic-engineering) in 2014 and my M.S. in Big Data and Text Analytics from [University of Essex](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/computer-science-and-electronic-engineering) in 2015, where I worked with [Udo Kruschwitz](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZCaIF_wAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Massimo Poesio](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=89aa1X0AAAAJ&hl=en). 

My research interests include Natural Language Processing, Language Modelling and Coreference Resolution. If you are an undergrad interested in these areas or machine learning research in general, feel free to reach out to me.
